# New York Times News Reader

## Overview

This app uses the NY Times Top Stories API to give users list of popular articles. When a headline is clicked, details from that story are displayed along with a link to read the full story on the New York Times website.

Users can select from a list of categories if they want more filtered stories according to the chosen section.

This was created as a take home technical challenge with the work being timeboxed to ~8 hours.
